### Visualization Assignment 1

The data set provided deals with world temperatures and comes from [NASA]((https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)).


**Here's the Viz: **

I labeled my x and y axes and included a title and legend for this chart. The goal of this visualization is to clearly communicate to the viewer that global temperatures are on the rise. I used the full sample of the data and when plotting decided it would look less noisy if I included a 5-year moving average calculation in addition to the raw values. I differentiated this from the actual values by increasing the width of the line as opposed to using different colors. I like this method because it preserves the noisiness of the data but makes the visualization more easily interpretable to the viewer. Overall, this visualization clearly shows that global temperatures are on the rise, especially since around 1980.
